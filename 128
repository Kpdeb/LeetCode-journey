question :

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.


code :
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
