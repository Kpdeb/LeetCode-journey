question :
You are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English letters. You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].

You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.

Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.

Note that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].


code :
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumCost(string source, string target,
                          vector<char>& original,
                          vector<char>& changed,
                          vector<int>& cost) {

        const long long INF = 1e18;
        vector<vector<long long>> dist(26, vector<long long>(26, INF));

        // distance to itself = 0
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
            dist[i][i] = 0;
// given conversions
        for (int i = 0; i < original.size(); i++) {
            int u = original[i] - 'a';
            int v = changed[i] - 'a';
            dist[u][v] = min(dist[u][v], (long long)cost[i]);
        }

        // Floyd-Warshall
        for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++)
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
                for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++)
                    if (dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j])
                        dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
long long ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < source.size(); i++) {
            int s = source[i] - 'a';
            int t = target[i] - 'a';
            if (dist[s][t] == INF)
                return -1;
            ans += dist[s][t];
        }

        return ans;
    }
};


code :
source =
"abcd"
target =
"acbe"
original =
["a","b","c","c","e","d"]
changed =
["b","c","b","e","b","e"]
cost =
[2,5,5,1,2,20]
Output
28
Expected
28
