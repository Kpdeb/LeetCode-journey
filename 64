question :
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

 
code :
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid):
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i == 0 and j == 0:
                    continue
                elif i == 0:
