question :
You are given an integer array bloomDay, an integer m and an integer k.

You want to make m bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use k adjacent flowers from the garden.

The garden consists of n flowers, the ith flower will bloom in the bloomDay[i] and then can be used in exactly one bouquet.

Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make m bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make m bouquets return -1.

code :
int minDays(int* bloomDay, int bloomDaySize, int m, int k) {
    if ((long long )m*k>bloomDaySize )
    return -1;

    int low = bloomDay [0];
    int high = bloomDay[0];

 for (int i=1 ; i<bloomDaySize ;i++){
        if (bloomDay[i]<low )
        low = bloomDay[i];
        if (bloomDay[i]>high )
        high = bloomDay[i];

    }
    int ans =-1;
